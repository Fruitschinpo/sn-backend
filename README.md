# sn-backend

The sortnight backend, designed to handle requests and add movies to a database.

## Wiki
Refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/Fruitschinpo/sn-backend/wiki)

## Usage

### How to run
You need to install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
You will also need to install [Clojure](http://clojure.org/getting_started)

Once you have installed both of them you will run the server by doing:
(in the terminal of your choice)
```
lein run
```
That will start the main function of the project. You can find it in the project.clj file.

You can then test to go to http://localhost:3000 and see that the server is running.

You did it!
