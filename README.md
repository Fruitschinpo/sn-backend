# sn-backend

The sortnight backend, designed to handle requests and add movies to a database.

## Usage

### How to run
You need to install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
You will also need to install [Clojure](http://clojure.org/getting_started)

Once you have installed both of them you will run the server by doing:
(In the terminal, might be different in windows. This is how you would do it in linux/mac)
(Inside the project folder)
```
lein run
```

You can then test to go to http://localhost:3000 and see that the server is running.

You did it!
